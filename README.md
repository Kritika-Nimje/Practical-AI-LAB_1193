## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various AI practicals completed as part of the Semester VI curriculum. The practicals focus on key concepts in Artificial Intelligence, including search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Practicals Implemented

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation**  
   Implemented BFS on a sample graph.  
   Explores nodes level by level to ensure the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation**  
   Implemented DFS on a sample graph.  
   Explores as deep as possible before backtracking, commonly used in pathfinding and puzzle-solving.

3. **8-Queens Problem**  
   Solved the 8-Queens problem using a backtracking approach.  
   Ensures that no two queens threaten each other on a standard chessboard.

4. **Introduction to Open Source NLP Tools**  
   Explored Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text analysis and processing.  
   Covered basic NLP tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and feature extraction.

5. **Text Preprocessing with NLTK**  
   Implemented preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming using NLTK.  
   Applied these techniques to a case study for preparing data for analysis.

## How to Run the Programs

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-practicals.git
   cd ai-practicals
